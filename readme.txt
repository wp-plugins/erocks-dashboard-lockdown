Dashboard Lockout & Buddypress Profile Redirect

== Description ==

Lock All Subscribers Out Of The Dashboard

Force Your Buddypress Users To Use The BP Profile Pages!

Any subscriber attempting to access a page under /wp-admin/ will be redirected to /wp-admin/profile.php.

Why?

Use a subscriber site, but don't want people seeing your wordpress dashboard? Have you ever logged in as a test user and noticed that a plugins setting page is visible to non admins? What about if you ran buddypress, and you wanted your subscribers to just use the BP profile pages for everything?

..If so, then this is for you!
